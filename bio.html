Lenka Zviadadze (Lenka Z) was born on September 6, 2001 in Tbilisi, Georgia. At the age of three, she made her television debut on “Imedi.” That same year, she won the children’s competition “Little Miss Caucasus” and received titles such as “Mini Miss Princess” and “Star of the Future.” By age four, Lenka was awarded a diploma “For Devotion to the Song” by the musical studio “Sisters Chokhonelidze.” She also began modeling for the studio “NOVA,” appearing in fashion shows and commercials.

At five, she was named “Georgian Miss Charm” at the beauty contest “Little Miss Georgia.” At six, Lenka joined the ballet studio under Vakhtang Chabukiani, directed by Nino Ananiashvili, and competed in the children’s musical contest “Ana Bana” on Rustavi 2.
